                            Writing is thinking in fact, during the process of writing itself, we might come up with
                            best ideas. Our team heads have more than 15 years of rich research experience especially in

                        <p>Our Approach</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Once a student engages our services, the first thing that we consider is the country of
                            origin, university or college of the student. Curriculum varies from nation to nation hence
                            it is imperative that we understand where the student is located and on that basis, we
                            modify our approach. Similarly, various colleges and universities follow diverse patterns
                            and might have specifications with regards to how a coursework is to be written. This is
                            another factor that we consider before we start the actual process of coursework writing.
                            Once these aspects have been identified, we then focus on the area of concern / topic /
                            subject. Accordingly, the task is assigned to a subject matter expert who has domain
                            knowledge in that area. The subject matter expert based on knowledge and experience
                            estimates the time that would be taken for completion (which depends on the topic) and
                            communicates the same to the student. However, under exceptional circumstances or based on
                            urgency, coursework can be completed within the timeframe as specified by the student. The
                            student is regularly updated about the progress of the work, and any doubts are clarified
                            prior to the commencement of the task. There is a single point of contact which assures that
                            there is no ambiguity in communication. The steps that we follow in executing the actual
                            work would comprise of: -
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understanding the topic</li>
                            <li>Creating an outline</li>
                            <li>Gathering latest references</li>
                            <li>Choosing relevant content</li>
                            <li>Interpreting the content in our own words</li>
                            <li>Copy-editing and proofreading</li>
                        </ul>
                        Referencing (as per the prescribed referencing style)

                                    findings would not have been possible without the accurate statistical analysis they
                                    offered. I was impressed by how well-developed the content was including the
                                    appendices and a structured literature review. I heartily endorse using their
                                    services. </p>

                                    all of our expectations. Personally, I appreciated the team's prompt follow-up, and

                                    gathered until I worked with PhD Assistance. Their data analysis services provide
                                    high-quality big data (through Hadoop, a Java-based platform). Their team identified
                                    hidden patterns and trends in the data, allowing us to make data-driven decisions
                                    that positively impacted our business. They also provided intuitive visualizations
                                    that made complex data easy to comprehend for all stakeholders. Thanks to their
                                    efforts, I've gained a competitive edge in our industry." - Jane Doe, Head of Data

                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Ph.D. Assistance serves as an external mentor to brainstorm your idea and translate that into
                            research
                            model. Hiring a mentor or tutor is common and therefore let your research committee known
                            about the same.
                            We do not offer any writing services without the involvement of the researcher, and
                            therefore we’re merely
                            a translator for non-native English speakers and our services are merely restricted to
                            research scholars
                            to hasten their research process. We offer following services to research scholars across
                            the globe: ideas
                            to translating in writing, editing, proofreading, plagiarism correction, statistical
                            analysis, coding and
                            algorithm, illustration and formatting.
