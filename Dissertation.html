                        <h3>Writing a Ph.D. Dissertation can seem overwhelming</h3>
                        <p>Dissertation or Thesis are used interchangeably today; the American Institutions at large
                            prefer the word ‘dissertation’ while European Institutions are accustomed to the word
                            “thesis.” In North America, the word “dissertation” is primarily used for Ph.D. work of a
                            student while the thesis is preferred for Master’s degree. The thesis or dissertation
                            normally refers to the culmination of a student’ research as a final requirement for the
                            degree sought (Fitt et al. 2009). Although thesis refers to Master’s dissertation, since in
                            general researchers call Ph.D. as thesis, we use the word thesis for Ph.D. dissertation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A Doctorate in Philosophy (Ph.D. or DPhil) is one of the highest academic degrees. Ph.D.
                            appear to represent unique configurations. and doing a Ph.D. is oriented around research,
                            believed in creating new knowledge by conducting independent research in his or her chosen
                            area. Advance a provocative thesis that speaks to large controversies by refuting and
                            refining an argument, reveal a gap, fill a gap, ask a new question or refine an older
                            question. To conduct research in an area, Ph.D. researchers require deep knowledge in that
                            area, and related areas, and the working experience on research problem (problems whose
                            outcome are not known). In other words, to gain the awards, a student is typically required
                            to make a substantial original contribution to knowledge, evidenced through a thesis that is
                            examined by academic peers. Hence to develop such compatibility among researchers, usually
                            Ph.D. programs have three components in them.</p>
