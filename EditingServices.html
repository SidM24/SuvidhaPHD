                        <p>As a researcher, you must have gone through so many research papers. Out of those, you might
                            have enjoyed something, but some might not have drawn your attention. Ponder for a while,
                            why didn’t the paper draw your attention. This reflects that; there is something missing or
                            lacking in the content, i.e. the paper is unedited. The same thing holds good for a Ph.D.
                            related paper like thesis or dissertation. Research paper without editing would fail to
                            convey the purpose accurately. Most students and scholars are worried that language and
                            formatting issues could prove to be a barrier in getting their paper published or accepted.
                            Since the written work must be refined for easy comprehension as well as gaining insights
                            over the researched topic, our professional editors refine the language in your assignments,
                            coursework, scientific, scholarly, technical or medical manuscripts. With our services, your
                            papers can be enhanced significantly.

                        work must be refined for easy comprehension as well as gaining insights over the researched
                        topic. Therefore, the edge of Editing is a must, and this is the area where students fail to

                    <h4>Transcription</h4>
                    <p>Transcription is a critical element as it’s a process that is theoretical, interpretive and
                        representation of human experience. However, transcribing such textual data is challenging, as
                        it demands conceptual equivalence without concern for lexical comparability.</p>

                    <h4>Plagiarism correction</h4>
                    <p>Plagiarism refers to the act of “appropriation of another person’s language, ideas or other
                        original (not common-knowledge), process, results, words without acknowledging its sources.”
                        Plagiarism is considered as a serious breach of ethics and therefore, no excuse will lessen the
                        breach.</p>

                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Ph.D. Assistance serves as an external mentor to brainstorm your idea and translate that into
                            research
                            model. Hiring a mentor or tutor is common and therefore let your research committee known
                            about the same.
                            We do not offer any writing services without the involvement of the researcher, and
                            therefore we’re merely
                            a translator for non-native English speakers and our services are merely restricted to
                            research scholars
                            to hasten their research process. We offer following services to research scholars across
                            the globe: ideas
                            to translating in writing, editing, proofreading, plagiarism correction, statistical
                            analysis, coding and
                            algorithm, illustration and formatting.
