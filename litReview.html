                        <p>A dissertation literature review contributes 40 percent of weight. Hence, more effort should
                            be taken to collect exhaustive, up-to-date literature, which has been published from various
                            countries or conducted among different ethnic groups. The challenging things in literature
                            review are: Comparison of different authors’ view, critically viewing the methodology,
                            finding gaps in research, going through the research study having linkage to previous
                            studies, understanding the parameters of research, etc. All these challenging needs do
                            require reviewing the literature extensively. In this respect, the requisite is to collect
                            relevant literature including the aspect of empirical, historical, philosophical literature
                            related to a problem stated. A review of available literature is an important part of any
                            academic research study.

                            Literature Review Mentoring Support</h4>
                        <p>Our team of Ph.D. experts will carry out an extensive review of contextual published research
                            on relevant theoretical concepts or models on which you intend to base your dissertation. It
                            requires comparing the views and conclusions of a wide range of authors to have own views.
                            The views enunciated out of it must be 'critical' in nature and not just a regurgitation of
                            the literature. We will try to highlight the limitations or contentious aspects of studies
                            you have gone through (for example, their theoretical underpinnings, research design or
                            interpretation of findings) or identify gaps in the literature. Identifying the gap in the
                            study is the rationale behind reviewing literature.</p>
                        <p>However, there is a systematic way to review the literature to identify and discuss the key
                            themes and contributions. This results in getting aware of relevant issues on the part of
                            researchers. Others have received far less attention, perhaps because their origins are
                            relatively recent or because they have simply been neglected. Hence, the need is to have the
                            quality of research studies at the disposal having relevance to your research topic. Once
                            the Ph.D. dissertation literature is reviewed, we will reflect the gaps in the literature
                            for addressing and/or which models/frameworks or ideas will take forward to help structure
                            Ph.D. literature review.</p>

                            problem and furnishes the uniqueness and importance of the present study with that of
                            earlier published study (identification of research gaps). With the research gaps, a
                            research framework will be developed based on the available empirical literature for the
                            Ph.D. dissertation literature to contribute significantly to frame the research.</p>

                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Ph.D. Assistance serves as an external mentor to brainstorm your idea and translate that into
                            research
                            model. Hiring a mentor or tutor is common and therefore let your research committee known
                            about the same.
                            We do not offer any writing services without the involvement of the researcher, and
                            therefore we’re merely
                            a translator for non-native English speakers and our services are merely restricted to
                            research scholars
                            to hasten their research process. We offer following services to research scholars across
                            the globe: ideas
                            to translating in writing, editing, proofreading, plagiarism correction, statistical
                            analysis, coding and
                            algorithm, illustration and formatting.
