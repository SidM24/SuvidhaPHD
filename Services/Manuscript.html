                        </h3>
                        <p>Research is "the application of scientific approach to the study of a problem" to acquire
                            reliable knowledge. The knowledge from the research is disseminated through avenues such as
                            conferences, books and journal papers. Dissemination of knowledge through conference is done
                            through proceedings. Further, publishing books is also a good way of disseminating
                            information but it's becoming outdated in research. Moreover, most books are getting
                            published under commercial value and hence publishing the work through journals offers
                            better potential to the researcher as it can provide up to date research. To accept and get
                            published in research journals, the researcher should have up to date knowledge of the field
                            and familiarity with writing research papers. Writing academic article demands cutting-edge
                            knowledge in their field of study. Replicating research unless there is a justification on
                            how the phenomenon might be different due to contextual factors, may not represent a "me
                            too" syndrome. Ph. D Assistance guides you in writing journal articles and in editing,
                            proofreading and formatting.

                                    Additionally, they skillfully assembled and delivered my project giving special

                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Ph.D. Assistance serves as an external mentor to brainstorm your idea and translate that into
                            research
                            model. Hiring a mentor or tutor is common and therefore let your research committee known
                            about the same.
                            We do not offer any writing services without the involvement of the researcher, and
                            therefore we’re merely
                            a translator for non-native English speakers and our services are merely restricted to
                            research scholars
                            to hasten their research process. We offer following services to research scholars across
                            the globe: ideas
                            to translating in writing, editing, proofreading, plagiarism correction, statistical
                            analysis, coding and
                            algorithm, illustration and formatting.
